"""
A `binary gap` within a `positive integer N` is `any maximal sequence` of `consecutive zeros` that is `surrounded by ones` at `both ends` in the `binary representation` of N.

For example, `number 9` has `binary` representation `1001` and `contains` a `binary gap` of length `2`. The `number 529` has `binary` representation `1000010001` and `contains` two `binary` gaps: one of `length 4` and one of `length 3`. 

The `number 20` has `binary` representation `10100` and `contains` one `binary gap` of length 1. The `number 15` has `binary` representation `1111` and has `no binary gaps`. The `number 32` has `binary` representation `100000` and has `no binary gaps`.

Write a function:

    def solution(N)

that, given `a positive integer N`, `returns the length` of its `longest binary gap`. The function should `return 0` if N `doesn't contain a binary gap`.

For example, given `N = 1041` the `function` should `return 5`, because N has `binary` representation `10000010001` and so its `longest binary gap is of length 5`. Given `N = 32` the `function` should `return 0`, because `N` has `binary` representation `'100000'` and `thus no binary gaps`.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
